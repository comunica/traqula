# Traqula Chevrotain package

Exports the [Chevrotain](https://chevrotain.io/docs/) package and tries to bundle a CJS version too.
This is NOT a redistribution of Chevrotain, not should a project outside of Traqula depend on this.

The reason for exporting is so the transpiled versions of the traqula packages use the same version of Chevrotain (instead of copying).

## Installation

```bash
npm install @traqula/chevrotain
```

or

```bash
yarn add @traqula/chevrotain
```

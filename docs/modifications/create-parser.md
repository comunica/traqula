# Create Parser

Traqula provides a generic core to create a modular [LL(K)-grammar](https://chevrotain.io/docs/features/llk.html) parser
([read our paper for full details](TODO: link)).
Typically, modularity is provided on Parser granularity, allowing you to create a parser by extending an existing parser.
This kind of extension is similar to how Object-Oriented programming languages allow you to create a class by extending another
(see: [Chevrotain](https://chevrotain.io/docs/features/grammar_inheritance.html), [ANTLR4](https://chevrotain.io/docs/features/grammar_inheritance.html)).
Traqula takes the modularity to the level of grammar rules, allowing you to create a parser by starting from an existing one, then adding, removing or patching existing rules, even allowing you to merge parsers (more information can be found on [modifying a parser](./modify-parser.md)).

> [!note]
> Traqula heavily relies on [Chevrotain](https://chevrotain.io/) to perform efficient parsing.
> Traqula's core itself merely provides a modular system to create a Chevrotain parser using [builder](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder)-based [dependency injection](https://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html).

## Chevrotain

Since Traqula starts from Chevrotain, it is important to know that all Chevrorain's documentation is relevant for Traqula to. We will however highlight some core functions:

1. **CONSUME(x)**: Consume a given lexer token.
2. **OPTION(x)**: optionally parse the following
3. **OR(x)**: parse only one from a list of options - first matching gets executed
4. **MANY(x)**: parse the provided many (0 or more) times
5. **MANY_SEP(x)**: parse the provided many times, expecting the consumption of a token between each time
6. **AT_LEAST_ONE(x)**: parse the provided one or more times
7. **AT_LEAST_ONE_SEP(x)**: parse the provided one or more times, expecting the consumption of a token between each time.
8. **ACTION**: perform an action - required for [embedded parsers](https://chevrotain.io/docs/tutorial/step3b_adding_actions_embedded.html) and semantic control.
Every interaction with results from any of the Chevrotain functions need to be in an ACTION since the result is undefined at [grammar recording time](https://chevrotain.io/docs/guide/internals.html#grammar-recording).
9. **SUBRULE(x)**: parse a provided subrule (grammar rule).

These functions are provided to the `ParserRule` `impl` function of `@traqula/core`.
We used the notation `CONSUME(x)` to note that both CONSUME does exist but also `CONSUME1` up to `CONSUME9`,
When providing the same argument to for example `CONSUME`, Chevrotain requires you to index the occurrence so the parser knows _'where it is at'_.

> [!note]
> Since Chevrotain is [ESM only](https://chevrotain.io/docs/changes/BREAKING_CHANGES.html#_11-0-0), but we want to target both CJS and ESM, Traqula depends on a Chevrotain wrapper `@traqula/chevrotain`.

## Creating a lexer

To create a lexer, one simply defines a [token](https://chevrotain.io/docs/tutorial/step1_lexing.html#our-first-token) using `createToken` from `@traqula/core`,
which is a smart typed wrapper around the version Chevrotain provides.

We define a token that parser 'test' in a case-insensitive way:

```typescript
import {createToken} from "@traqula/core";
// We recommend using cpaitalized names for tokens.
const testToken = createToken({ name: 'Test', pattern: /TEST/i });
const wordToken = createToken({ name: 'Word', pattern: /[a-z]+/i });
```

To create a lexer, you simply add them to a `LexerBuilder`, and build lexer:

```typescript
import {LexerBuilder} from "@traqula/core";
const myLexerbuilder = LexerBuilder.create().add(wordToken, testToken)
```

However: LexerBuilders function as an arrayBuilder where the lexer will lex tokens checking in the order of that array. In our example above our lexer would thus never lex the `testToken` because 'test' would first match the `wordToken`. To this end we manipulate our builder:

```typescript
// Move the testToken before the wordToken in our array.
myLexerBuilder.moveBefore(wordToken, testToken)
// Alternitavely:
const myOtherLexerBuilder = LexerBuilder.create().add(testToken, wordToken);
```

> [!note]
> Chevrotain will try to warn you if a token can never be matched.

Using a lexerBuilder, you can either create a [Chevrotain lexer](https://chevrotain.io/docs/tutorial/step1_lexing.html#using-the-lexer) using `.build()`, or get the tokenVocabulary to provide to the parser builder using `.tokenVocabulary`.

## ParserRule

Traqula's core package exposes [ParserRule](https://comunica.github.io/traqula/types/_traqula_core.ParserRule.html) which is the type used to create a single grammar rule.
The type expects you to specify the `Context` the rule expects, a `name`, the type the rule returns,
and optionally the
[parameters](https://chevrotain.io/docs/features/parameterized_rules.html#parameterized-rules) of the grammar rule.
You should then declare the rule as an object containing the `name`,
and an `impl` that receives the chevrotain specific functions, returning a function thet receives: the context, and all parameters, which in turn returns something of the returnType.
below we define a simple rule named `myRule` (we suggest starting with a lowercase letter here), requiring a context `{ myKey: 'myValue' }`, and a single string parameter, returning the string `apple`:
```typescript
//                           context      -      name  -  returnType - list of arguments
const myRuleObj: ParserRule<{ myKey: 'myValue' }, 'myRule', 'apple', [ string ]> = {
  name: 'myRule',
  impl: ({ CONSUME, SUBRULE, ACTION }) => (context, firstRuleParameter) => {
    CONSUME(testToken);
    SUBRULE(otherRule);
    return ACTION(() => 'apple');
  }
}
```

> [!note]
> When calling a subRule (e.g. `SUBRULE(otherRule)`), Traqula does NOT just call the implementation (`impl`) on that `otherRule`. Instead, it calls the rule that is _currently registered in the parser_ under the same name, providing the key to Traqula's modularity.

> [!important]
> Always provide the [string literal type](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#literal-types) for the rule name, as the ParserBuilder will help you at compile time to verify the construction.

## Build Parser:

In order to build a modular parser, we group together the various grammar rules in a `ParserBuilder`.
The ParserBuilder will check that name (which works as the reference to the grammarRule) is only added once.
TypeScript will error on a call that tries to add a rule that is already contained within the builder.

```typescript
const myParserBuilder = ParserBuilder
  // <const> cast required in .create()
  .create(<const> [myRuleObj, otherRule]);
```

In case you want to merge a whole ParserBuilder,
you can call `.merge()` and provide the other ParserBuilder, possibly requiring you to resolve conflicts when name clashes present.

Building the chevrotain parser is possible using `.build()`, interestingly, Chevrotain allows [multiple start rules](https://chevrotain.io/docs/features/multiple_start_rules.html), so you can parse starting from any grammar rule.

```typescript
myParserBuilder.build({
  tokenVocabulary: myLexerBuilder.tokenVocabulary,
});
```
